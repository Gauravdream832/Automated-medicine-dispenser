# Automated-medicine-dispenser

An automated medicine dispenser is like a smart box that helps you remember to take your medicine on time. It's designed to make sure you never forget your pills. Here's how it works: Loading Medicines: You start by putting your different medicines into the dispenser. Think of it like filling compartments with your pills for different times of the day. Setting Schedule: You tell the dispenser when you need to take each type of medicine. For example, you might set it to remind you to take the blue pill in the morning and the red pill in the evening. Reminders: When it's time to take your medicine, the dispenser gives you a friendly reminder. It could be a sound, a light, or even a message on a screen. Dispensing: When you confirm that you're ready to take your medicine, the dispenser opens the right compartment and gives you the pills you need for that time. Record-keeping: The dispenser keeps track of when you took your medicine. This is helpful for you and your doctor to see if you've been keeping up with your medication. Notifications: If you forget to take your medicine, the dispenser might send a message to your phone or another device to remind you. Refill Alerts: The dispenser can also let you know when you're running low on medicine, so you can refill it in time. In simple terms, it's like having a helpful friend that reminds you to take your medicine and gives you the right pills at the right time, making it easier for you to stay healthy.
